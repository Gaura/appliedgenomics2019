### Question 1. Coverage simulator [10 pts]

- Q1a. How many 100bp reads are needed to sequence a 1Mbp genome to 5x coverage?

- Q1b. In the language of your choice, simulate sequencing 5x coverage of a 1Mbp genome and plot the histogram of coverage. Note you do not need to actually output the sequences of the reads, you can just randomly sample positions in the genome and record the coverage. You do not need to consider the strand of each read. The start position of each read should have a uniform random probabilty at each possible starting position (1 through 999,900). You can record the coverage in an array of 1M positions. Overlay the histogram with a Poisson distribution with lambda=5

- Q1c. Using the histogram from 1b, how much of the genome has not been sequenced (has 0x coverage). How well does this match Poisson expectations?

- Q1d. Now repeat the analysis with 15x coverage: 1. simulate the appropriate number of reads, 2. make a histogram, 3. overlay a Poisson distribution
  with lambda=15, 4. compute the number of bases with 0x coverage, and 5. evaluated how well it matches the Poisson expectation.


### Question 2. de Bruijn Graph construction [10 pts]
- Q2a. Draw (by hand or by code) the de Bruijn graph for the following reads using k=3 (assume all reads are from the forward strand, no sequencing errors, complete coverage of the genome)

```
ATTC
ATTG
CATT
CTTA
GATT
TATT
TCAT
TCTT
TGAT
TTAT
TTCA
TTCT
TTGA
```

- Q2b. Assume that the maximum number of occurrences of any 3-mer in the actual genome is 3 using the k-mers from Q1a. Write one possible genome sequence


- Q2c. What is the longest repeat? (use the same assumptions as Q2b)


### Question 3. BWT Encoding [10 pts]

In the language of your choice, implement a BWT encoder and encode the string below. Linear time methods exist for computing the BWT, although for this assignment you can use the simple method based on standard sorting techniques. Your solution does *not* need to be an optimal algorithm and can use O(n^2) space and O(n^2 lg n) time. 

Here is the recommended pseudo code (make sure to submit your code as well as the encoded string):

```
computeBWT(string s)
  ## add the magic end-of-string character
  s = s + "$"
 
  ## build up the BWM from the cyclic permutations
  ## note the ith cyclic permutation is just "s[i..n] + s[0..i]"
  StringList rows = []
  for (i = 0; i < length(s); i++)
    rows.append(cyclic_permutation(s, i))

  ## just use the builtin sort command
  sort(rows)

  ## now extract the last column
  string bwt = ""
  for (i = 0; i < length(s); i++)
    bwt += substr(rows[i], length(s),1)
  return bwt
```

String to encode:
```
I_am_fully_convinced_that_species_are_not_immutable;_but_that_those_belonging_to_what_are_called_the_same_genera_are_lineal_descendants_of_some_other_and_generally_extinct_species,_in_the_same_manner_as_the_acknowledged_varieties_of_any_one_species_are_the_descendants_of_that_species._Furthermore,_I_am_convinced_that_natural_selection_has_been_the_most_important,_but_not_the_exclusive,_means_of_modification.
```


### Question 4. BWT Decoder [10 pts]

In the language of your choice, implement a BWT decoder and decode the string below. 

One of the essential properties of the BWT is that it can be decoded back into the source text without any other additional information. This is accomplished by iteratively applying the Last-First property starting with the first character of the BWT until reaching the end of string character `'$'`. The Last-First property states there is an equivalence between the ith occurrence of a character in the first column and the ith occurrence of that character in the last column. This equivalence can be evaluated by counting how many occurrences of a character are present in the BWT string (the last column of the BWM) or by counting characters in the first column (which you will have to determine from the BWT itself). Again, faster methods exist (the FM-index) to determine the rank of each character but you can just count it explicitly here

The pseudocode for decoding the string is as follows:

```
decodeBWT(String bwt) 
  String firstCol = makeFirstColumn(bwt)
  String text = ""
  
  ## By construction, '$' always starts the zeroth row
  row = 0;
  while (bwt.charAt(row) != '$')
      text.append(bwt.charAt(row));
      row = applyLF(firstCol, bwt.charAt(row), rank(bwt, row));
  
  return reverse(text)
```

String to decode:
```
.uspe_gexr_______$..,e.orrs,sdddeedkdsuoden-tf,tyewtktttt,sewteb_ce__ww__h_PPsm_u_naseueeennnrrlmwwhWcrskkmHwhttv_no_nnwttzKt_l_ocoo_be___aaaooaAakiiooett_oooi_sslllfyyD__uouuueceetenagan___rru_aasanIiatt__c__saacooor_ootjeae______ir__a
```

Hint: use your sourcecode from Q3 to debug Q4. Also start with simple strings like GATTACA or your own name.


### Packaging

The solutions to the above questions should be submitted as a single PDF document that includes your name, email address, and 
all relevant figures (as needed). Make sure to clearly label each of the subproblems and **give the exact commands** you used for 
solving the question. Submit your solutions by uploading the PDF to [GradeScope](http://www.gradescope.com/). 

If you submit after this time, you will start to use up your late days. Remember, you are only allowed 4 late days for the entire semester!
